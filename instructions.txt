Clone VisionArt from github:
git clone https://github.com/simo-net/VisionArt /path/to/VisionArt
(e.g.: git clone https://github.com/simo-net/VisionArt ~/PycharmProjects/VisionArt)

Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project that should use VisionArt:
cd ~/PycharmProjects/MyProject

Create virtual environment:
python3 -m venv ./visionartenv

Activate virtual environment:
source ./visionartenv/bin/activate

Install the VisionArt repository (with its dependencies) in the virtual environment (note that -e flag stands for editable, use it if you want to easily edit VisionArt):
python3 -m pip install -e /path/to/VisionArt
(e.g.: python3 -m pip install -e ~/PycharmProjects/VisionArt)

Now you are ready to go!
Start by generating some FEM sequences, then calibrate your camera and camera-monitor system and finally record some data.

When you are done, deactivate the virtual environment:
deactivate
