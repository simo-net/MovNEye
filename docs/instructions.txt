Clone MovNEye from github:
git clone https://github.com/simo-net/MovNEye /path/to/MovNEye

Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project that should use MovNEye:
cd ~/PycharmProjects/MyProject

Create virtual environment:
python3 -m venv ./movneyenv

Activate virtual environment:
source ./movneyenv/bin/activate

Install the VisionArt repository (with its dependencies) in the virtual environment (note that -e flag stands for editable, use it if you want to easily edit MovNEye):
python3 -m pip install -e /path/to/MovNEye

Now you are ready to go!
Start by generating some FEM sequences, then calibrate your camera and camera-monitor system, and finally record some data.
When you are done, deactivate the virtual environment.
